Assignment A  basic- 1
Can you implement the sing() method for the bird?
YES.
Changed the Animal Class as Abstract Class and added the abstract methods
	abstract void fly();
	abstract void sing();
a. How did you unit test it?

Created a Test Class com.singtel.java.BirdTest.java 
b. How did you optimize the code for maintainability?

Changed the Animal class initially to Abstract Class.But may be changed to Interface based on future requirements (An interface is better than a abstract class when you want multiple classes to implement that interface and when you don't have to inherit default behavior)
